  description: |-
    An endpoint for clients to determine the availability of symbol service for the current VSTS account.

    This controller does not sit behind any feature flag.

    The controller returns 200 if the service is available. Any other codes indicate that the service is not available.
    For now, only 404 is used explicitly, but the client may also receive 500 if an internal error arises. In the future
    we may add 402 to indicate a license issue.

    Visual Studio IDE calls this when connecting to symbol server, but it doesn't use SymbolHttpClient due to restrictions
    on binplacing micro-service DLLs inside Team Explorer package.
