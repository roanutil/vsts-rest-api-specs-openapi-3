        Materialize an existing AAD or MSA user into the VSTS account.

        NOTE: Created users are not active in an account unless they have been explicitly assigned a parent group at creation time or have signed in
          and been autolicensed through AAD group memberships.

         Adding a user to an account is required before the user can be added to VSTS groups or assigned an asset.

         The body of the request must be a derived type of GraphUserCreationContext:
          * GraphUserMailAddressCreationContext - Create a new user using the mail address as a reference to an existing user from an external AD or AAD backed provider.
          * GraphUserOriginIdCreationContext - Create a new user using the OriginID as a reference to an existing user from an external AD or AAD backed provider.
          * GraphUserPrincipalNameCreationContext - Create a new user using the principal name as a reference to an existing user from an external AD or AAD backed provider.

         If the user to be added corresponds to a user that was previously deleted, then that user will be restored.

         Optionally, you can add the newly created user as a member of an existing VSTS group and/or specify a custom storage key for the user.
