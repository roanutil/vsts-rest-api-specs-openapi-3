  description: Git annotated tags are tags with additional metadata including the
    person who created the tag and a comment.
- name: Blobs
  description: Blobs are files in the Git repository.
- name: Cherry Picks
  description: |-
    This API provides a way to cherry pick into a new branch either a specific commit or commits that are associated to a
    pull request.
- name: Commits
  description: Controller to handle all REST calls against commits
- name: Diffs
  description: |-
    Diffs compare a target version with a base version and return a list of items that are only in the target version.
    If either the target or base version isn't specified, then the default branch is used.

- name: Import Requests
  description: Create, query, and update requests to import data from another source
    control system.
- name: Items
  description: |-
    Items are the files, folders, and submodules in a repository.
    Files are represented by blobs and folders are trees.
    If the repository contains submodules, they will appear as commits.
- name: Merge Bases
  description: Ways to find merge base(s) between commits.
- name: Merges
  description: Merge endpoints provides a way to perform git merge operation.
- name: Policy Configurations

    \ information, see \n[Improve code quality with branch policies](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=859025)"
- name: Pull Request Attachments
  description: This API provides a way to create and retrieve files that have been
    attached to a pull request
- name: Pull Request Comment Likes
  description: |-
    This API provides methods for marking comments on pull requests as liked.
    Liking a comment is a used as a way of indicating agreement with the author.
- name: Pull Request Commits

- name: Pull Request Iteration Changes
  description: Controller to handle all REST calls against pull request iterations
- name: Pull Request Iterations
  description: |-
    Provides REST API methods for Git pull request iterations.
    Iterations are created as a result of creating and pushing updates to a pull request.
- name: Pull Request Iteration Statuses
  description: |-
    Pull request statuses can be posted on pull request iteration to indicate that status links particular iteration. Iteration statuses behave the same way
    as pull request statuses, but can expire on new source updates when StatusPolicy is properly configured.

    Pull request statuses provide extensibility to the pull request experience. Third party services or users with read permission to the repository
    can create and get statuses associated with a pull request or an iteration via this REST API. An example of pull request status can be "CI Build Passed",
    "Integration tests pending", "Linting check succeeded".
    In order to update a status create a new status with the same genre and name values.
- name: Pull Request Labels
  description: "Pull Request labels provide extensibility to the pull request experience.\
    \ \nThird party services or users with read permission in the repository can\n\
    create, get, and delete labels associated with a pull request via this REST API.\n\
    Labels are used to provide quick insights into a pull request, an example\ncan\
    \ be labelling a Pull request as \"WIP\", \"Feature\", or \"Bug\" to let others\n\
    know the state and purpose of the Pull Request.\n\nLabels are posted to the pull\
    \ request and will be displayed in both the details and list views for pull requests."
- name: Pull Request Properties
  description: |-
    This API provides a way to manage external properties associated with a pull request. Third party services can use this API
    to store additional information on the pull request without maintaining their own storage.

        These are the properties that can be updated with the API:
         - Status
         - Title
         - Description (up to 4000 characters)
         - CompletionOptions
         - MergeOptions
         - AutoCompleteSetBy.Id
         - TargetRefName (when the PR retargeting feature is enabled)
         Attempting to update other properties outside of this list will either cause the server to throw an `InvalidArgumentValueException`,
         or to silently ignore the update.

      - Pull Request Iteration Statuses
      description: |-
        Create a pull request status on the iteration. This operation will have the same result as Create status on pull request with specified iteration ID in the request body.

        The only required field for the status is `Context.Name` that uniquely identifies the status.
        Note that `iterationId` in the request body is optional since `iterationId` can be specified in the URL.
        A conflict between `iterationId` in the URL and `iterationId` in the request body will result in status code 400.
