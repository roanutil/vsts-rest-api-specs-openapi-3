        Set the upstreaming behavior of a package within the context of a feed

        The package does not need to necessarily exist in the feed prior to setting the behavior.
        This assists with packages that are not yet ingested from an upstream, yet the feed owner wants
        to apply a specific behavior on the first ingestion.
